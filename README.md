# WeatherApplication
In this Django Project Tutorial, I will be building a Weather Application with Django through the help of an API. The API that will be in use is the OpenWeatherMap API. This API will enable us to fetch the Weather Forcast of any city around the world.

## Features

- Search for weather conditions in a specific location.
- Display current weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
- Responsive user interface for desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: Html,CSS
- Back-end: Django

 ## Back-end Setup:
 
   - Install Python and pip if not already installed.
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   - Start the Django development server with `python manage.py runserver`.
